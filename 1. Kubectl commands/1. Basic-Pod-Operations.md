# Basic Pod Operations

## [ ] kubectl get pods, kubectl describe pod, kubectl delete pod

### kubectl get pods
```bash
# Get all pods in current namespace
kubectl get pods

# Get pods with more details
kubectl get pods -o wide

# Get pods from all namespaces
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get pods -A  # Short form

# Get pods with specific labels
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp

# Get pods with custom output formats
kubectl get pods -o yaml
kubectl get pods -o json

# Watch pods in real-time
kubectl get pods -w

# Filter pods by status
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Running
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Pending
```

### kubectl describe pod
```bash
# Get detailed information about a pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Describe pod in specific namespace
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Example with actual pod name
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod

# What kubectl describe shows:
# - Pod metadata (name, namespace, labels)
# - Pod status and conditions
# - Container information and states
# - Events and troubleshooting info
# - Resource requests/limits
# - Volume mounts and secrets
# - Network information (IP, node)
# - QoS class and tolerations
```

### kubectl delete pod
```bash
# Delete a specific pod
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

# Delete pod in specific namespace
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Delete multiple pods
kubectl delete pod pod1 pod2 pod3

# Delete all pods with a label
kubectl delete pods -l app=myapp

# Delete using YAML file
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml

# Force delete (use with caution)
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --force --grace-period=0

# Delete with custom grace period
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --grace-period=30

# Delete and wait for completion
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --wait=true
```

## Common Pod Statuses

| Status | Description | Action |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Pending | Pod accepted but not scheduled | Check node resources, constraints |
| Running | Pod is running on a node | Normal operation |
| Succeeded | All containers terminated successfully | Completed job/task |
| Failed | At least one container failed | Check logs, resource limits |
| Unknown | Pod state cannot be determined | Check node connectivity |
| CrashLoopBackOff | Container keeps failing and restarting | Check logs, fix application |
| ImagePullBackOff | Cannot pull the container image | Verify image name, registry access |

## Quick Reference Examples

```bash
# Basic workflow
kubectl get pods                    # List all pods
kubectl describe pod <name>         # Get pod details
kubectl delete pod <name>           # Delete pod

# Troubleshooting workflow
kubectl get pods                    # Check status
kubectl describe pod <problem-pod>  # Get detailed info
kubectl delete pod <problem-pod>    # Remove if needed
```
